# mac_monitor_keep_awake

Running this script will keep your Mac awake as if you were actively at the keyboard and mouse, even when you aren't.

If this script isn't giving 100% of the behaviour you're looking for, try combining it with App Store app [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amphetamine/id937984704) - this can help.
